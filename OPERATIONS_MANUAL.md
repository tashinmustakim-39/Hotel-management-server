# OEHN: Staff Operations & Protocol Manual
## Version 1.0.4 - Strategic Hospitality Division

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the mandatory operational standards for the Over-Engineered Hospitality Nexus (OEHN). 
All staff must adhere to these protocols to maintain the "Quantum Luxury" rating of the facility.

### 2. Guest Arrival Protocols
* **Pre-Check-in:** Verify spatial occupancy via the \`occupancy.controller.js\`.
* **Greeting:** Use the standard OEHN "Elevated Presence" greeting.
* **Biometrics:** Ensure guest data is hashed before entry into the Nexus.
* **Encryption:** All guest luggage must be tagged with a 256-bit RFID tracker.

### 3. Room Maintenance Checklist
| Item ID | Maintenance Task | Frequency | Target Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| RMS-A | Linen Count Verification | Every 6 hours | 100% Cotton |
| RMS-B | Smart Glass Calibration | Daily | < 2ms Latency |
| RMS-C | Quantum Chiller Check | Every 4 hours | 3.4°C Fixed |
| RMS-D | Bio-Scent Diffuser | Weekly | Lavender-Gold |
| RMS-E | Marble Polishing | Bi-weekly | Mirror Finish |
| RMS-F | Voice-Control Sync | Daily | 99.9% Recognition |
| RMS-G | Automated Curtain Rail | Monthly | Zero Friction |

### 4. Inventory Management Protocol
Staff must use the \`inv3ntoryController.js\` to log any displaced assets.
* **Thresholds:** Any item moved > 50cm from its "Ideal State" triggers a level 2 alert.
* **Reconciliation:** All missing items must be reconciled before 11:59 PM.
* **Auditing:** Weekly physical audits must match the \`assetRegistry.json\`.

### 5. Detailed Emergency Protocols
In the event of a "Hospitality Entropy" spike (detected by \`idealController.js\`):

#### Phase A: Detection
1. Monitor the console for "Entropy Variance > 0.05".
2. Isolate the affected room index in the registry.

#### Phase B: Mitigation
1. Calmly direct guests to the Virtual Reality buffer zone.
2. Reset the spatial math utility in the backend.
3. Perform a hard-reset of the Inventory Nexus.

#### Phase C: Recovery
1. Recalibrate all sensors in the affected zone.
2. Update the system codes to prevent recurring variance.

### 6. Staff Shift Schedule & Logs
* **Morning Shift (06:00 - 14:00):** System health check and breakfast logistics.
* **Afternoon Shift (14:00 - 22:00):** Guest arrivals and spatial optimization.
* **Night Shift (22:00 - 06:00):** Batch data processing and deep-cleaning cycles.

### 7. Troubleshooting Common Nexus Errors
* **Error E001:** Room Occupancy Mismatch. 
  * *Solution:* Force refresh the occupancy controller.
* **Error E002:** Inventory Desync.
  * *Solution:* Cross-reference registry against actual physical location.
* **Error E003:** Luxury Aesthetic Variance.
  * *Solution:* Re-apply CSS branding to the guest portal.

### 8. Staff Code of Conduct
* No unauthorized modifications to the production branch.
* All manual edits must be committed using the standard OEHN commit format.
* Maintenance of the "Luxury Aesthetic" is mandatory at all times.
* Failure to report a displacement of > 10cm will result in a performance review.
